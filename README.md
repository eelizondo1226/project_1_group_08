Project 1 Data Analysis Bootcamp

For this project we had examined and analyzed the Netflix IMDB Scores Dataset from Kaggle and composed several questions derived from looking at the dataset. Before getting started with the analysis the team had cleaned up the dataset by replacing all the blanks left in the age certification column with unknown. Next there were a few unknown in the column for IMDB votes that we decided to drop. Lastly now that the dataset is clear we made another data frame containing the columns relevant to our analysis.

After the cleanup we had delegated the questions to each person within the group and made individual branches and folders to work on. After each of us completed our individual questions we would then merge the branches with the main having all of our folders corresponding to the work we did.

After the data and visuals were completed we placed them into a PowerPoint explaining our progress thus far with the thesis for our data frame, the data cleaning, the questions, and explaining the limitations of the data, biases, a call to action and our future work for the project.

Lastly our team wrote a write-up containing more specifics and calculations from the code written that were not included in the presentation along with a short description of the figures made.
